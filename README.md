# Lab Physics - Phys 231 
#### This repo contains each of 6 labs and associated data sets I did over the course of last semester. 
#### The purpose was to take data from the lab and do data and error analysis for each using python, all of which were done in google colab.
#### Each folder contains the code taken from a python notebook, with the only alteration being the filepath for pulling data is changed to be within the repo rather than from my google drive.
#### There is also a subfolder for data in each folder, which the file directory in the code pulls from.
#
#### This is meant to showcase what I have done, there should be some progression in quality and complexity of code.
#### The order I did them was CAP, G, C, FIB, DIFF, GAM. 
#### You will notice that CAP was one of the most difficult to code and I happened to be doing it first by chance. 
# 
### Error Calculation
#### Most of the python files should include a series of variables labeled in a format like: dXdy.
#### These are meant to present partial derivatives which are used for the standard formula for calculating propogated error in multivariable functions, where there is error on more than one of the measured variables.
#### For my purposes and my skill level in python at the time of taking this class, manually typing these out was logistically the best choice.
