# Repo-1
# This repo contains each of 6 labs and associated data sets I did over the course of last semester. 
# The purpose was to take data from the lab and do data and error analysis for each using python, all of which were done in google colab.
# Each folder contains the code taken from a python notebook, with the only alteration being the filepath for pulling data is changed to be within the repo rather than from my google drive.
# There is also a subfolder for data in each folder, which the file directory in the code pulls from.
#
# This is meant to showcase what I have done, there should be some progression in quality and complexity of code.
# The order I did them was CAP, G, C, FIB, DIFF, GAM. 
# You will notice that CAP is coded horribly - it was probably one of the most difficult to code and I happened to be doing it first.
